## Hi I`m Tolunay :wave:

As a self-motivated extrovert person, I am a good communicator and I work collaboratively with a team. I am a responsible and curious person and for this reason, I learn quickly. I give importance to improve myself all the time. Computer programs are in my field of interest.

I worked on web design programming languages and Frameworks. As programming languages, I have been studying JAVA, C#, Javascript. Among these programs, my main focus is on Java. I mostly used Microsoft SQL and MySQL query languages for Database operations. While I was working on Nodejs, I carried out my studies using MongoDB, which is NoSQL.

I want to advance my career as a Back End developer.

### Strong languages: Java, SQL
